DESCRIPTION				     *ReplaceWithRegister-description*

Replacing an existing text with the contents of a register is a very common
task during editing. One typically first deletes the existing text via the
|d|, |D| or |dd| commands, then pastes the register with |p| or |P|. Most of
the time, the unnamed register is involved, with the following pitfall: If you
forget to delete into the black-hole register ("_), the replacement text is
overwritten! 

This plugin offers a two-in-one command that replaces text covered by a
{motion}, entire line(s) or the current selection with the contents of a
register; the old text is deleted into the black-hole register, i.e. it's
gone. (But of course, the command can be easily undone.) 

The replacement mode (characters or entire lines) is determined by the
replacement command / selection, not by the register contents. This avoids
surprises like when the replacement text was a linewise yank, but the
replacement is characterwise: In this case, no additional newline is inserted. 

RELATED WORKS								     *

- regreplop.vim (vimscript #2702) provides an alternative implementation of
  the same idea. 
- operator-replace (vimscript #2782) provides replacement of {motion} only,
  depends on another library of the author, and does not have a default
  mapping.

USAGE						   *ReplaceWithRegister-usage*

							     *gr* *grr* *v_gr*
["x][count]gr{motion}	Replace {motion} text with the contents of register x. 
			Especially when using the unnamed register, this is
			quicker than "_d{motion}P or "_c{motion}<C-R>"
["x][count]grr		Replace [count] lines with the contents of register x. 
			To replace from the cursor position to the end of the
			line use ["x]gr$ 
{Visual}["x]gr		Replace the selection with the contents of register x. 

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				    *ReplaceWithRegister-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ReplaceWithRegister.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES				    *ReplaceWithRegister-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) autoload script (optional). 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				   *ReplaceWithRegister-configuration*

The default mappings override the (rarely used, but somewhat related) |gr|
command (replace virtual characters under the cursor with {char}). 
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>ReplaceWithRegister... mapping targets _before_ sourcing this script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <silent> <Leader>r  <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterOperator
    nmap <silent> <Leader>rr <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterLine
    vmap <silent> <Leader>r  <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterVisual
<
==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS				     *ReplaceWithRegister-limitations*

- The commands don't work on the readonly registers ":, "., "% and "#. "E384:
  Invalid register name" is printed. 
- The commands don't work on the expression register "=. Nothing is pasted. 
- The mode cannot be set for register "/; it will always be pasted
  characterwise. Implement a special case for glp?

HISTORY						 *ReplaceWithRegister-history*

1.20	26-Apr-2011
- BUG: ReplaceWithRegisterOperator didn't work correctly with linewise motions
  (like "+"); need to use a linewise visual selection in this case. 
- BUG: Text duplicated from yanked previous lines is inserted on a replacement
  of a visual blockwise selection. Switch replacement mechanism to a put in
  visual mode in combination with a save and restore of the unnamed register.
  This should handle all cases and doesn't require the autoindent workaround,
  neither. 

1.10	21-Apr-2011
- The operator-pending mapping now also handles 'nomodifiable' and 'readonly'
  buffers without function errors. 
- Add experimental support for repeating the replacement also in visual mode
  through visualrepeat.vim. Renamed vmap <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterOperator to
  <Plug>ReplaceWithRegisterVisual for that. 
  *** PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CUSTOM MAPPINGS ***
  A repeat in visual mode will now apply the previous line and operator
  replacement to the selection text. A repeat in normal mode will apply the
  previous visual mode replacement at the current cursor position, using the
  size of the last visual selection. 

1.03    07-Jan-2011
- ENH: Better handling when buffer is 'nomodifiable' or 'readonly'. 
- Added separate help file and packaging the plugin as a vimball. 

1.02    25-Nov-2009
Replaced the <SID>Count workaround with :map-expr and an intermediate
s:ReplaceWithRegisterOperatorExpression. 

1.01    06-Oct-2009
Do not define "gr" mapping for select mode; printable characters should start
insert mode. 

1.00	05-Jal-2009
First published version. 

0.01	11-Aug-2008
Started development.
