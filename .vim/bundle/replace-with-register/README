DESCRIPTION
Replacing an existing text with the contents of a register is a very common
task during editing. One typically first deletes the existing text via the
d, D or dd commands, then pastes the register with p or P. Most of
the time, the unnamed register is involved, with the following pitfall: If you
forget to delete into the black-hole register ("_), the replacement text is
overwritten! 

This plugin offers a two-in-one command that replaces text covered by a
{motion}, entire line(s) or the current selection with the contents of a
register; the old text is deleted into the black-hole register, i.e. it's
gone. (But of course, the command can be easily undone.) 

The replacement mode (characters or entire lines) is determined by the
replacement command / selection, not by the register contents. This avoids
surprises like when the replacement text was a linewise yank, but the
replacement is characterwise: In this case, no additional newline is inserted. 

RELATED WORKS
- regreplop.vim (vimscript #2702) provides an alternative implementation of
  the same idea. 
- operator-replace (vimscript #2782) provides replacement of {motion} only,
  depends on another library of the author, and does not have a default
  mapping. 

USAGE
["x][count]gr{motion}
			Replace {motion} text with the contents of register x. 
			Especially when using the unnamed register, this is
			quicker than "_d{motion}P or "_c{motion}<C-R>"
["x][count]grr
			Replace [count] lines with the contents of register x. 
			To replace from the cursor position to the end of the
			line use ["x]gr$ 
{Visual}["x]gr		Replace the selection with the contents of register x.
