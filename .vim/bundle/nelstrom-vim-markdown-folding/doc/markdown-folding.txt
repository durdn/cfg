INTRODUCTION				       *markdown-folding-introduction*

This plugins enables you to fold markdown documents by section headings. It
recognizes both styles of heading that markdown permits, namely:

    # h1 signaled by one hash symbol

    ## h2 signaled by two hash symbols

    ### h3 etc. (up to h6)

As well as:

    h1 signaled by '=' underline
    ============================

    h2 signaled by '-' underline
    ----------------------------

Two different folding styles are supported: stacked (the default) and nested.

						    *markdown-folding-stacked*
The stacked folding style creates a flat list of sections. When all folds are
closed, the outline resembles a fully expanded table of contents. That is, h1,
h2, h3 etc. headings are all represented equally.

Implementation details: all sections (h1, h2, h3 etc.) initiate a fold with
foldlevel=1.

						     *markdown-folding-nested*
The nested folding style creates a heirarchical list of sections. When all
folds are closed (by pressing |zM| or running :set foldlevel=0), the outline
resembles a table of contents (ToC) that only shows h1 sections.

Opening the h1 folds (by running :set foldlevel=1) reveals the content of that
section, with any h2 sections outlined as a ToC.

Opening an h2 fold (by running :set foldlevel=2) reveals the content of that
section, with any h3 sections outlined as a ToC. And so on...

Implementation details: h1 sections initiate a fold with foldlevel=1, h2
sections initiate a fold with foldlevel=2, and so on.

============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				      *markdown-folding-configuration*

The stacked folding style is the default.
						       *g:markdown_fold_style*
To make the nested folding style the default, put this in your |vimrc|
file:>
    let g:markdown_fold_style = 'nested'
<

						*markdown-folding-:FoldToggle*
You can switch between the stacked and nested folding styles by running
the command:>
    :FoldToggle
<

The fold style is scoped to each window, which means it's possible to use the
stacked folding style in one split window, and the nested folding style in
another.
